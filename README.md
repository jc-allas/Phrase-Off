Phrase-Off is a word guessing game built with Python where the player competes against a bot to uncover a hidden phrase. The phrase is randomly selected from a list, and both the player and bot take turns guessing letters. The bot uses a simple strategy by guessing letters that appear most frequently in English first, improving its chances of solving the phrase. When a correct letter is guessed, it is revealed in the phrase, helping both sides get closer to solving it. The game continues until one side correctly guesses the entire phrase. This project helped me practice key Python skills such as loops, conditionals, string manipulation, and designing turn-based game logic.
